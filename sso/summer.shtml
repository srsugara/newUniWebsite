<p>If you are interested in exploring summer camps / college programs for HS students and volunteer opportunities, now is the time to begin your search.  While we do not endorse any particular program, we are providing you with links and resources to help you with your search.  
 
Keep in mind that attending a summer camp on a college campus is *not* the only option during the summer months.  Seeking employment; volunteering, career exploration via job shadowing / internships, and talking with professionals about their career path / informational interviewing are all great things to do over the summer.  We are in a resource rich community -- take advantage of it!  :-)   

Talk with the SSO counseling staff about ways to explore your interests.  All of these suggestions should compliment a fun & relaxing summer filled with time for family & friends too .  Balance is key!  
 Happy hunting! Please do not hesitate to contact us.  As always, tap into your teachers at Uni too -- to inquire about subject specific camps and ways to explore your passions,
 </p>
