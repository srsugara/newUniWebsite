<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>You can print to the Uni High lab printers from anywhere -- whether from a Uni High lab or from your personal desktop, laptop computer or mobile device at any location. When you send a print job to a Uni High printer, the job is queued until you come to the lab and release it from the printer by entering your NetID and password.</p>

<em>Note: If printing from off-campus please connect using the VPN client. More information about configuring the Tech Services VPN is available at:</em> <a href="http://techservices.illinois.edu/services/virtual-private-networking-vpn">http://techservices.illinois.edu/services/virtual-private-networking-vpn</a> <br>  
<br> 
<h2>Web Print</h2>

<p>Web Print is a service to provide printing from laptops without the need to install print drivers. This feature is available in the Uni High computer labs and library. Visit <a href="https://papercut.ics.illinois.edu">https://papercut.ics.illinois.edu</a> and select Web Print on the left-hand side to upload the file and select the desired printer. Your print job is then sent to the print release station.</p>
