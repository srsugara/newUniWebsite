                        Students may elect to take independent study courses with Uni faculty or with professors at the University of Illinois. Independent studies usually involve studying specific topics more in-depth than what one would experience in a regular course. <strong>Criteria for Independent Study</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The independent study proposal must represent a study opportunity that is above and beyond the courses offered in the Uni High curriculum. Independent study proposals that duplicate courses offered at Uni will not be considered</li>
                            <li>The independent study proposal should enhance curriculum innovation consistent with the laboratory mission of Uni High.</li>
                            <li>Independent study courses will not satisfy the "300-minute rule".</li>
                            <li>Students must complete the paper work in order for an Independent Study to be registered.</li>
                        </ul>
