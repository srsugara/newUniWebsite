                    <div>(1/2 unit)</div>

                    <p>The Computer Literacy program is a sequence of two one semester courses, usually taken in the subfreshman and freshman years. The subfreshman level course focuses on skills essential to success in future high school classes, with a minimum of theory or programming. It emphasizes solid proficiency in important personal computing "survival" skills, including basic word processing, electronic mail, library resources, Internet research, online and print design and publishing, ethical use of technology, and basic use of the Microsoft Windows and MacOS operating systems.

                    </p>



                    <h4><u>Computer Literacy 2 Freshman</u></h4>
                    <div>(1/2 unit)</div>
                    <div><i>Prerequisite: Computer Literacy 1 or equivalent</i></div>
                    <p>
                    Computer Literacy 2 is the second-semester course in introductory computer applications for freshmen (and other new students). It complements Computer Literacy 1, and focuses on group work completing a major project involving computers to research and present information on a topic chosen by the students. Students will use their skills in online research, desktop publishing, presentation software, web authoring, and data manipulation acquired during the Computer Literacy 1 course, while gaining new experience in group cooperation, self-teaching about new computer software, and integrating many different computer skills. Formal units on legal and ethical issues in information science, advanced use of library and online information resources, web development and presentation design are also included.</p>
                    <p>We offer two different sections of Computer Literacy 2 in the fall and spring semesters. One is oriented toward computer technology projects (programming, electronics, networks, robotics, etc.), and the other emphasizes creative and media projects such as audio, video, photography, design, social media, etc. Students can choose which of these interests them most on the course selection form, but enrollment will not be guaranteed, depending on how many students pick each option.
                    </p>

                    <h4><u>Computer Programming</u></h4>
                    <div>10th - 12th grade</div>
                    <div>(1 unit)</div>
                    <div><i>Prerequisite: Computer Literacy 2 or equivalent</i></div>
                    <p>
                    Computer Programming is a full year, in-depth introduction to modern computer languages and programming. It will introduce students to structured programming techniques including procedures, functions, data structures, important algorithms, program design and object-oriented programming, using C and C++ as the example languages. Students will also explore related aspects of the UNIX operating system, including shell scripts and programming tools. The curriculum includes a minimum of computer theory and history necessary to understand the programming concepts. Students must have a computing applications background equivalent to the Computer Literacy 2 course, but need not have any previous experience in computer programming.

                    <div><i>Prerequisite: Computer Literacy 2 or equivalent</i></div>
                    <p>At the nexus of art and technology, this class is an introduction to writing, producing, performing and editing in
                    electronic media including sound recording, video and film, with an emphasis on their distribution in new outlets
                    including the Web, cable, independent film and podcasting. Students will have the opportunity to create news, nonfiction,
                    instructional, animation, comedy and drama programming for both traditional radio and television outlets
                    and the evolving digital media. We will learn to use cameras, recorders, microphones, lighting and editing
                    equipment to complete audio and video projects, equally emphasizing the technical, historical and creative aspects
                    of media production. Students will be able to develop their on-camera and on-microphone speaking, acting and
                    presentation skills as well as working "behind the camera." (Offered in 2016-2017, then alternating years) </p>
