                        Introductory Biology is a one-semester course required of all students. The main goal of the course is to introduce students to a wide variety of biological topics and current areas of biological research. Introductory Biology begins with a "macro" emphasis, focusing on properties of life and diversity of life forms. The course then moves to a "micro" emphasis, examining basic biochemistry, cell structure and function, cell division, transmission genetics, DNA structure and function, gene expression, genetic engineering and evolution. Laboratory activities, simulations, discussions and computer/Internet resources play an integral role in this course.

                        Organismal Biology, an elective one-semester course, introduces students to a wide variety of organismal biology topics and current areas of biological research. The course begins by examining principles of population biology, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, ecosystems, nutrient cycling and competition. The latter half of the course involves examination of comparative structure and evolutionary relationships of various taxa of microbes, fungi, protists, plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates. Laboratory activities, simulations, discussions, and computer/Internet resources play an integral role in this course.

                        Introductory Chemistry is a one-semester course required of all students. Chemistry is considered by some to be the central science because the study of matter and its changes is fundamental to understanding all other sciences. This course will introduce the major concepts of chemistry with special attention being given to the language, symbols and models of chemistry. Students will explore these concepts via classroom demonstrations, laboratory experiments and computer modeling.

                        Introductory Physics is a one-semester course required of all students. The goal is to introduce the field of physics through the study of Classical Mechanics, emphasizing concepts and basic analytical methods. It begins with the relationship of force to motion; then covers Newton's Laws and their implications, especially conservation laws. Momentum and impulse, energy and work are defined and discussed. In the last part of the semester, this knowledge is applied to the study of solid structures and to fluids. Being a self-contained course, Introductory Physics serves all students as an introduction to the field; for those who intend to continue the study of physics, the methods and concepts covered in this course compose the foundation of all further development. Whenever appropriate, applications of physical concepts to engineering and other fields of science are discussed.

                        This one-semester elective reviews and builds on the first year of physics by covering in greater depth classical mechanics. Topics may vary based on student interest, but typically include: Newton's laws, friction, reference frames and center of mass, rotation, the Universal Law of Gravitation, scaling relationships in structures, and Bernoulli's Principle. Time permitting, a review of thermodynamics and an introduction to statistical mechanics and entropy will also be covered. Assessments will require both numerical problem-solving and formal developments. Because derivatives of polynomials and transcendentals are used, prior or concurrent enrollment in calculus, or consent of the instructor, is required.

                        This one-semester elective builds on Physics A, stressing current applications in science. Topics may vary with student interest, but typically include: electricity and magnetism (Maxwell equations, radiation), wave phenomena (lumped-circuit analogies, diffraction), relativity, and quantum mechanics. Formal development, rather than numerical problem solving, is emphasized. Because derivatives of polynomials and transcendentals are used, prior or concurrent enrollment in calculus, or consent of the instructor, is required.

The challenge of providing access to clean water will be investigated in detail. Civil engineering hydrology, chemical engineering water purification, as well as flow and watershed will be covered. The class will coordinate with University of Illinois departments. Students will learn about research performed at the University; faculty will talk to the students about the research and will provide some access to their laboratories.

                        This elective, non-laboratory, one-semester course develops a systems approach to energy by investigating the science, economics, and externalities (such as infrastructure, environmental effects, and political policies) of energy. The course will begin by developing an understanding of the history of energy. The current production, uses, and economics of fossil fuels will be examined. The majority of the course will look at three types of renewable energy: wind, solar, and biomass.
