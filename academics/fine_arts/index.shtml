                        The offerings of the Fine Arts Department foster awareness of the elements common to all the arts as well as of the distinctive characteristics of the various visual, verbal, and performing arts. We want students to cultivate an awareness of and appreciation for the various art forms while developing their own criteria for making informal value judgments. When students learn to create and/or perform in images, gestures, sounds and words, they discover new ways to shape and share their ideas with others. As a result of these experiences, the students are challenged to continue to experience the arts as creator, re-creator, and/or intelligent consumer. Whenever possible and appropriate, we will use appropriate instruments, electronic equipment, computers and networks to access information, process ideas and communicate results.
