                        <b>Craig Russell</b><a href="mailto:hcrussel@uni.illinois.edu"> (hcrussel)</a> is a Teaching Associate and Executive Teacher who earned his B.S. in mathematics at MIT in 1983, then served in Hawk and Patriot units in Germany for seven years before being "assigned" to RPI, where he earned an MS in Applied Mathematics and completed all but dissertation requirements for the PhD in 1992. He was then assigned to teach at the United States Military Academy (West Point), where he taught freshman and sophomore math courses and was the math department leader in a study involving issuing students laptop computers for class work. At West Point, Mr. Russell was bitten by the teaching bug, so he resigned from the Army to become a high school teacher. Mr. Russell's favorite people are his wife and two children, followed by students who like math. He is teaching Geometry and Accelerated Calculus 2/3.
